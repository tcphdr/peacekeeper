 A set of IPv4 and IPv6 network stress testing tools.

gcc file.c -o file ; ./file

This tool is pretty much EOL, it was public for a short time, however if you have access to this repo, I expect you to maintain my wish and keep it this way. Since the flipping of the "switcH" from public to private, various other changes, touchups, and bug fixes were implemented. I know I said it's EOL but I'll probably find something else broken and need to address it sooner or later. shrug.
