## README

This project and it's respective components have reached their end-of-lifetime, upon retiring the project I decided to release the code on GitHub. There will be no further updates or contributions to this project. It will be placed into read-only mode. The concept is still valid, however this tool is over thirty years old and has more issues than features. (While also being passed through hands like drugs at a party).


## DISCLAIMER
**THIS TOOL CAN CAUSE HARM TO A COMPUTER SYSTEM/NETWORK, PLEASE USE RESPONSIBILY AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE BREAKING THE LAW. ONLY USE THIS TOOL IN LAB ENVIRONMENTS ON LOCAL NETWORKS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.**
I am not responsible for your mishaps.
